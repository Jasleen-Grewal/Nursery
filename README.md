Build Instructions for 1305 Monochrome OLED Display:
====================================================
## Introduction:
The project aims to diplay the current temperature, humidity at a particular place. My diplay, Monochrome OLED Display 1305 is quite readable due to its high contrast. Moreover, this display is made of 128x32 individual blue OLED pixels, each one is turned on or off by the controller chip. Also, this display makes its own light therefore no background light is required. This results in reduction of power required to run the OLED and is why the display has such high contrast. I really like this graphic display for its crispness!<br>

## Budget
The stuff required to make my OLED working is Raspberry pi kit, which I brought from amazon. Another thing that was required was monochrome OLED Display, which I purchased from Adafruit.<br>
